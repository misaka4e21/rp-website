<p><strong>After capturing a major dam west of Kobane, SDF confederalists are advancing in 3 directions towards IS held land. Supported by coalition airstrikes the SDF are pushing to capture land that will enable Kobane to connect with Efrin, which has been under siege by al-Nusra and allied Islamist forces since the start of 2015.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>SDF</strong> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces"><strong>Syrian Democratic Forces</strong></a> are a newly formed combined force of Free Syrian Army, YPG and other allied rebel groups. They believe in a pluralist democratic Syria, and the group was formed after a conference in Rojava.</p>

<p>During November, the SDF pushed towards IS held areas of Raqqa and Hasakah.</p>

<p>Late December saw a buildup of SDF forces west of Kobane crossing on 25 December over to IS territory capturing Tishrin dam, a large hydroelectric power station. This adds a huge electric generating capacity to Rojava with IS unable to destroy the dam for fear of flooding their own areas and drastically worsening their situation.</p>

<p>This week SDF have advanced simultaneously from isolated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efrin"><strong>Efrin</strong></a> in the west, Kobane in the east and Aleppo in the south.</p>

<h3>SDF Has Crossed Turkey's Red Line</h3>

<p>The crossing puts the SDF on difficult footing with Turkey. The largest group in the SDF is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YPG"><strong>Rojavan YPG</strong></a> which is primarily Kurdish, but also recruits Arabs, Turks and westerners. The YPG has disputed links with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkk"><strong>PKK</strong></a> which has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for several decades.</p>

<blockquote>
“We will never allow the establishment of a [Kurdish] state in Syria’s north and our south. We will continue our fight in this regard no matter what it costs.”
- Erdogan, Turkish President, July 2015
</blockquote>

<p>Now the SDF is crossing <a href="http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/020720151">Erdogan's infamous red line</a>. The question is whether and how Turkey will react to the advance of YPG aligned forces. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3z7srw/lengthy_interview_with_pyd_cochair_salih_muslim/">January 2 interview</a>, Rojava representative, Salih Muslim claimed that currently only non-YPG SDF are crossing the river. He also underscored a commitment to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_confederalism"><strong>democratic confederalist</strong></a> Syria which is decentralized.</p>

<p>The implication is that Arab rebel groups are leading the fight to connect Efrin and will have sovereignty over the stretch of land between Kobane and Efrin. This answers Turkey's main opposition to a river crossing from Kobane.</p>

<div class="img-wrap post-banner"><img src="./page_en/pics/buffer-zone-banner.jpg" class="border" alt=""></div>
<p>There are <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPartizan_/status/681600821449101313">sporadic reports</a> of SDF several kilometers west of the Euphrates river, close to the major IS held city of Manbij. These positions were previously shelled by Turkish military when the YPG attempted to advance on them. Other sources <a href="https://twitter.com/VivaRevolt/status/681270539730681856">indicate Turkey will intervene</a> against SDF actions but this information is unconfirmed.</p>

<p>The Turkish PM, Ahmet Davutoglu says those who crossed the Euphrates are not part of the YPG but are Arab elements. He says "We have no information about PYD [Rojava] elements crossing the river".</p>

<p>The statement by Turkey's PM is a hands off signal but could change as the situation develops. Stratfor, an intelligence analyst company in its <a href="https://www.stratfor.com/forecast/annual-forecast-2016">Annual Forecast 2016</a>, claims Turkey will make a military move in north Syria, not only confronting IS but will also stop Kurdish expansion through an air campaign.</p>

<h3>SDF Advances From Three Fronts</h3>

<p>News sources are claiming that SDF are simultaneously advancing east from Efrin and north from Aleppo on two fronts.</p>

<p>Earlier today (January 4), <a href="http://aranews.net/2016/01/17411/">SDF claimed new ground</a> north of Aleppo after coalition airstrikes hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Nusra"><strong>al-Nusra (al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise)</strong></a> headquarters forcing them to withdraw from the village of Kashtaar after sustaining 20 casualties. The airstrike indicates tacit coalition support for recent SDF advances.</p>

<p>The coalition is supporting SDF which are now engaged in fighting in areas under control by various rebel groups. A US policy shift is occurring. These rebel groups were supported by the US at the start of the civil war. Furthermore Turkey has failed to act on its enforcement of a buffer zone and countering IS activity along its border.</p>

<p>The village was a staging ground repeatedly used by Nusra militants and allied Islamists for attacking Efrin.</p>

<blockquote>
“After fierce clashes, our forces were able to liberate Kashtaar and the surrounding farms from the terrorists. We seized a large deal of ammunition and heavy weapons from Nusra and its allies.”
- SDF announcement
</blockquote>

<h3>The Third Offensive</h3>

<p>SDF are advancing from Efrin in the west. Currently they are on the outskirts of Menagh airbase. Securing this airbase gives them a foothold in rebel territory to further advance to the major city of Azaz.</p>

<div class="img-wrap post-banner"><img src="./page_en/pics/efrin-offensive-airbase-advance-banner.jpg" class="border" alt=""></div>
<p>For the majority of the Syrian civil war, Efrin has remained on the defensive under constant attack from al-Nusra and other Islamist forces. This recent advance in the last week combined with the river crossing by SDF, signals ongoing military operations aimed at joining the cantons of Efrin with Kobane.</p>

<p>This advance early in the year with spring about to begin, puts this offensive in a good situation with time throughout the summer to continue operations.</p>

<h3>Overall Implications</h3>

<p>The advance affects the Syrian regime. Negotiations are ongoing to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/security-council-agrees-syria-peace-plan-151218210833550.html">develop a draft resolution</a> for peace talks. John Kerry, US secretary of state said any agreement would exclude IS and al-Nusra.</p>

<p>The Syrian regime is trying to marginalize all opposition groups except IS. Negotiations will not happen with IS so it is their interest to downplay legitimate opposition as a solution to the crisis.</p>

<p>The Tishrin dam's capture has several implications for the development of Rojava. The capture of the dam adds much needed electricity to Rojava and gives the SDF leverage over IS areas.</p>

<p>Capturing the border area would remove IS's last crossing with Turkey and cut a vital supply line for IS. This would isolate IS from access to outside areas.</p>

<p>Connecting Efrin with Kobane would relieve it from the embargo and threat of attacks. This enables important agricultural goods such as olive, cotton, and fruit from Efrin to flow into Rojava's markets.</p>

<p>Efrin is isolated, vulnerable and bullied. Connecting Efrin to Kobane, would prevent other groups from using it as leverage against Rojava and overall dramatically improve Rojava's economic and political situation.</p>
