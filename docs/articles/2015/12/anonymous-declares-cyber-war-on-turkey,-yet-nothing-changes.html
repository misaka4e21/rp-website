<p><strong>Sandwiched between Turkey and Daesh, lies Rojava under constant attack while leading the resistance. Yet they remain overlooked by activists who scramble to find a solution to rising fascist forces.</strong></p>

<p>Today members of Anonymous threatened new attacks against Turkey after leaks by a Turkish newspaper revealed secret communications between Turkish officers and IS.</p>

<blockquote>"Turkey is supporting Daesh by buying oil from them, and hospitalizing their fighters. We won't accept that Erdoğan, the leader of Turkey, will help any longer," - Anonymous statement</blockquote>

<p>After the Paris attacks in November, international media was awash with reports of IS attacks on the European heartland. Yet, the outpouring of emotion and the actions that followed amounted to little in a world increasingly mired in chaos and confusion.</p>

<p>For days the attacks occupied the media nonstop. Everyone was outraged calling for action. Anonymous redeclared their cyberwar against Daesh. Worldwide citizens held minutes of silence and lit candles. Online, Facebook accounts proudly displayed the French flag.</p>

<p>Now Anonymous has joined the crusade to fight Daesh. In reality, it is a publicity stunt winning nothing but support from Eurocentrics cashing in on a social media trend.</p>

<h3>Je Suis Charlie</h3>

<p>After the Charlie Hebdo shooting, Francois Hollande led a march commemorating the victims which became an ugly political competition and called for French national unity.</p>

<p>Groups like PEGIDA and Front National have seized the moment to rally support for defending the west from this image of a barbaric eastern rampage destroying the safehaven of white Europe.</p>

<p>Social democrat parties also jumped on this bandwagon, casually mentioning attacks in Beirut and Ankara to reassure us this is not a racist cause.</p>

<div class="img-wrap post-banner"><img src="./page_en/pics/marine-le-pen-banner.jpg" class="border" alt=""></div>
<div class="img-wrap post-banner"><img src="./page_en/pics/france-rally-banner.jpg" class="border" alt="Charlie Hebdo march. Far left, French PM, Francois Hollande. Far right, Turkish PM, Ahmet Davotglu who is a supporter of Turkish president, Erdogan."><span class="caption">Charlie Hebdo march. Far left, French PM, Francois Hollande. Far right, Turkish PM, Ahmet Davotglu who is a supporter of Turkish president, Erdogan.</span></div>
<p>Yet it was NATO ally Turkey that was complicit in the Ankara attacks that killed 102 peace protesters.  </p>

<p>Daesh never claimed responsibility. They are the bogeyman of international terror and a convenient proxy for power groups.</p>

<h3>Repeating Old Mistakes Again</h3>

<p>The same language from after September 11 is now used again on the public with great effect. And rather than questioning these narratives, the public calls for a fast remedy and to take action.</p>

<p>In October 1990, a midwife appeared on public television crying about the brutality of Iraqi soldiers towards babies in Kuwaiti hospitals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah">This tearful public testimony</a> was widely publicized and corroborated by Amnesty International. It swung public opinion in favor of the first Iraq war and was mentioned by President George Bush ten times in the following weeks.</p>

<p>On 15 March 1991, shortly after Kuwait was liberated by US forces, it was discovered that the testimony was false and engineered by a US PR firm. The woman speaking was the daughter of a Kuwaiti diplomat and the events never happened.</p>

<p>Despite a history of false government statements, the public continues to be led down the path of empowering the military industrial complex and further war rather than a culture of critical examination and mistrust for centers of power.</p>

<p>Then post-2001 when the coalition invaded Afghanistan, a public cloud of guilt transpired for the victims of Afganistan's despots. The prevailing narrative was we came to liberate the oppressed of Afghanistan who would welcome exported democracy with open arms.</p>

<p>The coalition built hospitals, and bombed villages. They built schools and shot civilians. They installed a regime to rule the civilians that was corrupt and despotic, and backed it up with military force.</p>

<p>The Soviets did the same in the 1980s. Except the US armed Islamic militants to oppose their presence in Afghanistan.</p>

<h3>White Lives Matter</h3>

<p>Europe is rebuilding old fences and walls, and countries are sealing themselves off.</p>

<p>Now Anonymous has joined the crusade to fight Daesh. In reality, it is a publicity stunt winning nothing but support from Eurocentrics cashing in on a social media trend.</p>

<p>Anonymous is a revolutionary idea. It is for all people, not just white middle-class Europeans. Now the name of Anonymous is being used to empower a European populist narrative counter to the decentralized global ideology of the Anonymous movement.</p>

<p>European progressive groups have given almost zero resistance to Islamist fascism sometimes bordering on apologism. This ground is now being ceded to nationalists and racists. It's critical that European progressives develop an analysis of Daesh and act against them, just as they would against any other fascist group.</p>

<h3>The Resistance is Here</h3>

<p>Now this resistance has been left to fascist sympathizers who are controlling the discourse.</p>

<p>The west faces a critical juncture. We can push back and stand for enlightenment values. For societies that are open, free and cosmopolitan. Or we can fall again into closed paranoid societies that empower nationalist groups.</p>

<p>The work of activists everywhere now, is to start questioning dominant narratives, and even criticize our own ideas. We have failed to capture the public imagination which is falling back onto reactionary politics. Rojava sets an example for a revitalization of movements that we can learn from.</p>

<p>Daesh is successful because they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/the-isis-guide-to-building-an-islamic-state/372769/">create a new system</a> on the ruins of obsolete nation-states. We have to do the same. Instead of clinging to a lost age we need to organize in new, localized and confederated communities. Burn down government institutions, form a commune and grow some potatoes between the rubble of the old world.</p>
